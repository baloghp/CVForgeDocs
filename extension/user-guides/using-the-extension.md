# Using the Extension

This guide covers how to effectively use the CVForge browser extension to capture job descriptions from any website and create application records in your CVForge account.

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Navigate to a Job Posting

1. Go to any website with a job posting
2. The extension works on any page - no special setup required

### Step 2: Capture the Job Description

**Method 1: Right-click on the page**
1. Right-click anywhere on the job posting page
2. Select **"CVForge"** from the context menu
3. Choose your PAT from the dropdown
4. The extension will capture the entire page

**Method 2: Select specific text**
1. Highlight the job description text you want to capture
2. Right-click on the selected text
3. Select **"CVForge"** from the context menu
4. Choose your PAT from the dropdown
5. The extension will prioritize the selected text

### Step 3: Wait for Processing

The extension will:
1. Show a loading notification
2. Process the content with AI
3. Extract job information
4. Create an application record
5. Show a success notification

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Selecting Specific Content

For better results, try selecting specific parts of the job posting:
- **Job Title**: Select the job title for accurate extraction
- **Job Description**: Select the main job description text
- **Company Information**: Select company details if needed

### Handling Complex Pages

Some pages may have complex layouts:
- **Try different selections**: Select different parts of the page
- **Use full page capture**: Right-click on empty areas for full page capture
- **Check submission history**: Verify the content was captured correctly

### Multiple Job Postings

When browsing multiple jobs:
- **Use the same PAT**: Keep using your configured PAT for consistency
- **Check for duplicates**: The extension will warn about duplicate URLs
- **Review submissions**: Check your submission history regularly

## Understanding the Results

### Success Notifications

When a job is successfully captured, you'll see:
- **Success message** with job details
- **Confidence score** (how confident the AI is about the extraction)
- **Application ID** for reference
- **Company name** and job title

### Error Messages

If something goes wrong:
- **Error notification** with details
- **Check the console** for more information (F12 → Console)
- **Try again** - some errors are temporary

### Submission History

View your submissions in the extension options:
- **Grid view** of all submissions
- **Filter by PAT** to see submissions for specific tokens
- **Status indicators** (success/failure)
- **Clickable URLs** to revisit job postings

## Best Practices

### Content Selection

**Do:**
- Select the main job description text
- Include company name and job title
- Select relevant details (requirements, benefits, etc.)

**Don't:**
- Select navigation menus or ads
- Include unrelated content
- Select too much or too little text

### PAT Management

**Do:**
- Use descriptive PAT names
- Set appropriate expiration dates
- Monitor usage regularly

**Don't:**
- Share PAT tokens
- Use expired tokens
- Create too many PATs

### Submission Management

**Do:**
- Review submissions regularly
- Check for failed submissions
- Clean up old submissions periodically

**Don't:**
- Ignore error messages
- Submit the same job multiple times unnecessarily
- Leave failed submissions unaddressed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
